<h3>Student projects</h3>

<p class="indent">I am available to supervise undergraduate projects in theoretical physics.  Information on the corresponding project modules is available through the <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/intranet/maths-current-students/maths-projects/">maths intranet</a> (login required).  The ideas below are just a few possible topics for projects, not an exhaustive list.  Interested students are welcome to chat with me about these or other possibilities.</p>

<p><b>Dark matter</b></p>

<p class="indent">The first stage of this project will be a survey of the evidence for dark matter and the experiments underway to constrain or reveal its fundamental nature.  With this background, the second stage will choose a particular dark matter proposal and delve more deeply into its features and ways it has been or may be tested.</p>

<p><b>Lattice Monte Carlo</b></p>

<p class="indent">Replacing continuous space and time by a finite lattice of discrete points enables numerical predictions of the properties of both statistical systems and quantum field theories (recasting the Feynman path integral as a partition function).  This project will apply this technique to investigate a simple lattice field theory, numerically analyzing phase transitions, non-trivial soliton solutions, or other phenomena.  Computer programming is likely to be a significant component of this work, and can be learned in the course of the project.</p>

<p><b>Quantum simulation</b></p>

<p class="indent">An important application of quantum computing is to simulate quantum systems that are not amenable to classical lattice Monte Carlo analyses.  After learning the basics of qubits and quantum gate operations, this project will explore recent proposals for quantum simulation using existing or near-future quantum devices.</p>

<p><b>Non-linear dynamics and chaos</b></p>

<p class="indent">This project will survey tools and techniques used to analyze chaotic dynamics in non-linear systems, probably but not necessarily focusing on numerical methods.  These techniques will then be applied to analyze some simple problems in any of the many areas of science where chaotic dynamics are important.</p>

<p><b>CPT and Lorentz invariance</b></p>

<p class="indent">The related symmetries of Lorentz invariance and CPT (charge--parity--time) invariance are among the cornerstones of modern physics.  This project will focus on learning about the observations and experiments that provide the most stringent tests of these important fundamental symmetries of nature.</p>

<p><b>Analysis techniques for time-series data</b></p>

<p class="indent">Time-series data are important in many different areas of mathematical sciences, from gene expression to finance to Monte Carlo calculations.  This project will involve becoming conversant with numerical techniques to analyze time series, and applying those techniques to real or synthetic data of interest.</p>
