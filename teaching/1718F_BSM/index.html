<h3>New strong dynamics beyond the standard model, Fall 2017</h3>

<p class="indent">Major experiments are underway and planned around the world to search for new physics beyond the standard model.  They are accompanied by comparable theoretical efforts to gain insight into issues including the stabilization of the electroweak scale and the nature of dark matter.  The possibility that such new physics may be strongly coupled presents both challenges for theoretical analyses as well as opportunities to advance our understanding of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">This course will introduce some of the most prominent proposed extensions of the standard model in which new strong dynamics play a central role.  After presenting the basic conceptual frameworks for both composite Higgs models and composite dark matter models, we will review current phenomenological constraints and the prospects for future discoveries.  We will also consider the role of lattice gauge theory as a means to obtain non-perturbative predictions for these strongly interacting systems.</p>

<h3>Learning outcome</h3>
<p>Upon completing this course, students will be able to:</p>
<ul style="margin-top:-12px;">
  <li>Explain the structure of representative composite Higgs and composite dark matter models.</li>
  <li>Interpret direct and indirect experimental constraints on these models.</li>
  <li>Judge the motivations and prospects of model-building proposals in the current literature.</li>
  <li>Describe the potential contributions of lattice calculations to investigate new strong dynamics, and their limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tentative schedule</h3>
<p class="indent"><b>2 November:</b> Course overview; Composite Higgs overview</p>

<p class="indent"><b>9 November:</b> Composite Higgs model building</p>

<p class="indent"><b>16 November:</b> Composite Higgs phenomenology</p>

<p class="indent"><b>21 November:</b> Composite Higgs constraints</p>

<p class="indent"><b>28 November:</b> Lattice gauge theory overview and application to composite Higgs models</p>

<p class="indent"><b>5 December:</b> Composite dark matter overview and model building</p>

<p class="indent"><b>12 December:</b> Composite dark matter phenomenology</p>

<p class="indent"><b>19 December:</b> Composite dark matter constraints; Lattice gauge theory applications</p>

<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>The expected background is exposure to quantum field theory and the standard model of particle physics, in particular gauge theories and spontaneous symmetry breaking, at the level of standard textbooks such as those by Peskin and Schroeder, Srednicki, or Schwartz.  We will briefly review the most relevant aspects of this background, with some flexibility to calibrate the level of the review.  Useful references on composite Higgs and composite dark matter physics include:</p>
