<h3>New strong dynamics beyond the standard model, Fall 2017</h3>

<p class="indent">Major experiments are underway and planned around the world to search for new physics beyond the standard model.  They are accompanied by comparable theoretical efforts to gain insight into issues including the stabilization of the electroweak scale and the nature of dark matter.  The possibility that such new physics may be strongly coupled presents both challenges for theoretical analyses as well as opportunities to advance our understanding of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">This course will introduce some of the most prominent proposed extensions of the standard model in which new strong dynamics play a central role.  After presenting the basic conceptual frameworks for both composite Higgs models and composite dark matter models, we will review current phenomenological constraints and the prospects for future discoveries.  Towards the end of the course we will consider the role of lattice gauge theory as a means to obtain non-perturbative predictions for these strongly interacting systems.</p>
