      While supersymmetry is most famous as a possible extension of the standard model of particle physics, at a more fundamental level it simplifies the systems in question, allowing profound insights into strongly coupled dynamics.  These include, for example, the concept of holographic duality between field theories and higher-dimensional gravity.  Lattice calculations provide a unique means to analyse supersymmetric field theories from first principles, enabling new tests of such dualities as well as potential new discoveries.<br><br>

      It is a remarkable possibility that the dark matter discovered by many different observations of the large-scale universe could consist of composite particles that contain electrically charged constituents.  These constituents interact with light but the composite particles they produce are dark, much like electrically charged quarks produce the electrically neutral neutron.  Lattice calculations have provided predictions for how such composite dark matter may be seen in ongoing experiments using large underground detectors.  Work is in progress to predict additional observable signatures of composite dark matter at high-energy particle colliders and future gravitational wave observatories.<br><br>

      The Higgs boson discovered in 2012 may be a composite particle arising from new strong dynamics beyond the standard model, which would explain how it is protected against large quantum corrections.  This possibility is currently being investigated by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider, which are imposing increasingly tight phenomenological constraints on composite Higgs models.  Using lattice field theory I am obtaining first-principles predictions for the behavior of representative new strong dynamics potentially underlying such models, to be compared against experimental results.<br><br>

      The investigations of composite Higgs physics discussed above find that agreement with experimental results improves for theories whose dynamics evolve slowly across a wide range of length scales.  This "near-conformal" dynamics is difficult to study through numerical lattice calculations, since only a limited range of length scales can be explored in computations that are practical to run using existing and foreseeable computing hardware.  This motivates developing and applying improved lattice techniques to study near-conformal field theories.<br><br>

      A long-standing challenge for lattice field theory is the analysis of systems with many more particles than anti-particles.  For example, in neutron stars there is a high density of baryons (protons and neutrons) with relatively few anti-baryons.  In lattice calculations that use standard importance sampling algorithms this leads to the appearance of nonsensical negative probabilities, which is known as a <em>sign problem</em>.  I recently began exploring novel algorithmic approaches designed to reduce the severity of sign problems in lattice calculations.<br><br>

      Phase transitions typically separate a phase with a broken symmetry from a different phase in which that symmetry is preserved, allowing the phases to be distinguished by a local order parameter.  More recently transitions have been discovered between distinct phases with the same symmetries, which are instead distinguished by non-local "topological" properties.  The importance of these topological phase transitions was recognized by the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics.  My work in this area investigates simple lattice field theories that may exhibit topological phase transitions, in particular considering a mechanism to generate particle masses without breaking any symmetries.<br><br>

The progress of the field depends on both developing improved numerical algorithms and implementing them efficiently on cutting-edge hardware.  In addition to the algorithm development I carried out for many of the physics-focused projects listed above, I have also worked on lattice fermion formulations with improved chiral symmetry as well as the issue of critical slowing down.
