      <b>Summary:</b> There are many algorithmic challenges to address in lattice field theory research, which can significantly impact which physics questions can be answered in a reasonable amount of time.  The progress of the field depends on both developing improved numerical algorithms and implementing them efficiently on cutting-edge hardware.  In addition to the algorithm development I carried out for many of the physics-focused projects listed above, I have also worked on lattice fermion formulations with improved chiral symmetry as well as the issue of critical slowing down.  In some cases it is best to explore these challenges in simpler test systems, which can provide excellent opportunities for beginners to quickly contribute to the field.<br><br>

<p class="indent">My research relies on steady advances in numerical algorithms complementing improvements in computing hardware.</p>

<p class="indent">A basic ingredient of lattice calculations is repeated solution of a linear system, <em>Ax=b</em>, where <em>A</em> is a large sparse matrix.  "Large" means that this matrix has millions of rows and millions of columns, involving far too much information to store in a computer's memory.  "Sparse" means that most of its elements are exactly zero.  Even storing only the relatively few non-zero matrix elements is outrageously inefficient.  Instead, we use iterative methods such as the conjugate gradient algorithm to solve this equation for <em>x</em> without explicitly allocating memory for the full matrix <em>A</em>.</p>

<!--
<p class="indent">In recent years, calculations involving disconnected diagrams have benefited greatly from the development and application of multigrid algorithms that dramatically decrease the computational cost of each solve.  Multigrid algorithms represent the physical system on a succession of coarser grids with smaller systems to solve, adaptively determining the best representation of the system on the coarser levels.  Applied to the studies reported in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0562">arXiv:1012.0562</a>, multigrid algorithms can reduce costs by up to an order of magnitude, which made possible a new direction of research: performing disconnected diagrams calculations that involve the light (up and down) quarks in addition to strange quarks.</p>

<p class="indent">On the hardware side, graphics processing units (GPUs) have produced comparable performance improvements in certain calculations.  GPUs can sustain enormous rates of computation, but memory and bandwidth constraints make it difficult to apply GPU computing to many common problems.  These sorts of difficulties will likely become more severe as high-performance computing continues to evolve in coming years.  Cheap and rapidly improving GPUs can be an ideal testbed for developing software that will get the most out of future computers.</p>

<p class="indent">I have performed research into the development of improved lattice fermion formulations with algorithms, .  A final interesting aspect of this line of research is that it can provide an entry point into the field.  We often use simple models to design and test improved techniques.  These smaller-scale computational projects can be more tractable for beginners, while still providing significant benefits to the field as a whole.</p>
